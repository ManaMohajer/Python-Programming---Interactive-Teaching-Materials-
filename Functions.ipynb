    "\n",
    "We have all heard this term, '**Function**', while studying mathematics in the highschool. \n",
    "\n",
    "**There are some functions that are already defined for us**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trigonometric Functions**:                                      `sin(X)`         `arcsin(X)`        `tan(X)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations of these functions are globally known and constant. We simply use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomial Functions**: for example, a linear function. We can select our desired name for that like Lin or f1:  `Lin(X,C)`   or    `f1(X,C)` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponential Functions**: We can select our desired name:                                  `Exp(X)`         or    `f2(X)`          \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the similiarities/differences among these functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each function has an individual `name` . (It is more understandable if you select a relevant `name` to define a new function. We will see in the next sections that we **can** define some functions anonymously in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each function gets individual `argument(s)` as input(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "-  Two parantheses `()` are a part of the notation of our functions.  We see difference between `sin()` and `sin`, the same is true for our computers! Even if our function does not need to get any `argument`, we have to insert `()` but leaving it empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We should not forget the separating comma `,` between `arguments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `arguments` can have different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we include functions in our programms? \n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** Simply speaking, we include the functions which are already defined by **using their name and passing the required arguments**! In the context of programming, we **call** the already-defined functions. They might be either defined by others, like `sin()`, or by us as new functions! If you **call** a function which is not yet defined, you will have error.  \n",

    "**b)** We **define** the new functions.\n",

    "Let us extract a framework being used to **call** the functions:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "In the context of mathematics, a framework for calling the functions looks like `Name_of_function(argument1,argument2,...,argumentN)`\n",

    "**Does this framework remind you any syntax that you used in the previous session?!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens when we call a function by using this framework?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we **call** a function, we pass the required `arguments`, if any, to the functions. Then, the programm enters into the definition of the function, the operations start to be executed. At the end, the function `returns` the output to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where does this output get available? After executing the line of the code where the function is called. We can save the output of our function, and use it further, by assigning it to a variable named here \"output\":\n",
    "\n",
    " `output = Name_of_function(argument1,argument2,...,argumentN)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## b) Defining new function: \n",
    "\n",
    "The expressions can contain basic mathematical expressions (devision,summation,multiplication,etc.), loops, printing, calling other function. These expressions are all written inside the **definition** of the functions. \n",

    "\n",
    "We **define** the expressions which need to be performed inside the function. If you **define** a function but you do not **call** it, practically you just waste your time! A defined function without being called is equivalent to nothing!\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary so far\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted two frameworks to **call** and to **define** functions in the context of maths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last session, we simply used `=` to **define** simple math operations, practically to assigned a value to a variable through math operations. The same concept makes sense for calling/defining a function. We define some expressions composed of mathematical operations, loops and conditional statements, then we assign the calculated value(s) to output variable(s). \n",
